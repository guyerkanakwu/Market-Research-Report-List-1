<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling-water Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Type</li><li>Water Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cooling-water machine market comprises two main types: air-cooled and water-cooled systems. Air-cooled machines utilize ambient air to dissipate heat, making them ideal for locations with limited water supply or where water usage is restricted. They are generally easier to install and maintain. In contrast, water-cooled systems use water for heat exchange, offering higher efficiency in heat removal and often resulting in lower operational costs. These systems are suitable for industrial applications where high cooling performance is essential.</p></p>

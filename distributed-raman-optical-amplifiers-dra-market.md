<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Raman Optical Amplifiers (DRA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Raman</li><li>Post Raman</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distributed Raman Optical Amplifiers (DRA) enhance optical signals in fiber networks using Raman scattering. The market is divided into Pre-Raman and Post-Raman types. In Pre-Raman DRA, amplification occurs before the signal reaches the fiber span, allowing for increased transmission distances. Conversely, Post-Raman DRA amplifies signals after they have traveled through the fiber, effectively boosting signal strength at longer distances. Both types improve network performance, but their deployment depends on specific requirements and design considerations of the optical system.</p></p>

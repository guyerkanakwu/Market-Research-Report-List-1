<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled</li><li>Water-Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modular chillers market is primarily divided into two types: air-cooled and water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled chillers utilize ambient air to dissipate heat, making them ideal for smaller applications with limited space and no access to water sources. Conversely, water-cooled chillers use water as the cooling medium, providing higher efficiency for larger installations and typically requiring a cooling tower. Both types are designed for scalability, allowing users to add modules as needed, enhancing energy efficiency and adaptability to varying load demands.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soluble Coffee Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p><p>The soluble coffee powder market is primarily divided into two types: spray-drying and freeze-drying. Spray-drying involves rapidly evaporating water from a coffee extract using hot air, resulting in a fine powder with a longer shelf life.
